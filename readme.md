In this blog, we tested 4 combinations of rRNA depletion and library prepration for shotgun metatranscriptome sequencing on 3 human stool samples. 
The purpose of this blog is to give transparent Quality Control (QC) workflow and results of shotgun metatranscriptome.
Note: Eversince Illumina stopped producing RiboZero rRNA depletion kit, the high efficiency rRNA depletion is difficult to achieve in human stool samples.
Please refer to the Jupyter notebook "Metatranscriptome_rRNAdep_Lib_2021.ipynb" for the description of the test and folder QC_results for detailed multiqc results.
Please note we only tested 3 samples and this blog should only be used as reference not your own rRNA depletion+library prepration decision.
